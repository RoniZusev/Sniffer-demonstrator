this project talkes about IDS - "Intruder Detection System"

I used the UI of tkinter in order to create app the simulates network (localhost) scanner that takes packets and sort them by:
* TCP/UDP or main proto
* Port
* IP adresses - source IP, Dest IP

The idea behind this project is to give a safe space to get into the packets that goes through your network,
this project can be usefull to avoid attack or just for recognizing them.

This image is the menu part that introduces the client into the app. 
There are 2 options - 
1. Sniffer.
2. Anylaze malware.

This image represents the sniffer as you can see there is a division by colomns of:
* TCP/UDP or proto 
* Port
* IP adresses - source IP, Dest IP

!*anylaze malware*!

This image talks about anylazing the sniffer that you launched before.
you can see in a graph what was the protocols that were found as the most popular and less popular.
and also you can see in a diffrent graph how over time the packets act (when the number of new packets is high and when is low).

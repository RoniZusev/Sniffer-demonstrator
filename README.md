this project talkes about IDS - "Intruder Detection System"
I used the UI of tkinter in order to create app the simulates network (localhost) scanner that takes packets and sort them by:
* TCP/UDP
* Port
* IP adresses - source IP, Dest IP

The idea behind this project is to give a safe space to get into the packets that goes through your network,
this project can be usefull to avoid attack or just for recognizing them.

!*STEP BY STEP THE SNIFFER*!
